## How to Contribute

### License

NMMA is released under the MIT license, which means that you are allowed to modify the code for your own purposes, as long as you retain our [copyright notice](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

However, we would love to grow the NMMA community, and integrate improvements directly into our [code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma).

### Including your changes

To make a code contribution to the project, follow these steps (which
are outlined in more detail in [this GitHub
guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)):

1. Make a fork of the [NMMA repository](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma)
2. Clone your fork, and add `upstream` (`git@github.com:nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma`) as a remote
3. Create a new branch and add your feature
4. Submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub

The other developers will provide feedback, and you may push updates
into the same branch (which will also update your pull request), until
the Continuous Integration tests pass and reviewers agree that it
should be merged (see "Process Guidelines: Reviews" below).

For a more detailed explanation of the open contribution process, see
the [scikit-image contributors' guide](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/contribute.html).
We follow a very similar process; some guidance follows below.

### Bug Reports

While we appreciate code changes, it is also very helpful simply to
know when NMMA does not function correctly.  Please [file any
issues](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma/issues) you run across.

If possible, provide:

1. A full description of your environment, including operating system,
   and Python version.
2. A minimal way to reproduce the problem you see; these can be either
   a set of instructions, or a script.

### Process guidelines

Because many developers work on NMMA, and PRs sometimes come in
at a rapid pace, we have guidelines to streamline review and
development:

### Code style

We don't like arguing about code style, and likely you don't
either. Therefore, we use code formatters: black for Python.
Code is an art, and opinions differ of what
looks good: we choose to spend our time writing correct, elegant code.

### Testing

All functionality should be accompanied by tests.  We use pytest and
PRs can only be merged once tests have been added and pass.
The continuous integration system indicates this
with a green checkmark, hence you may see developers talking about "PR
599 being green" âœ….
